    Climate change. It's real. It's serious. And it's up to us to solve it.<br>
    In the last two decades, we've experienced 14 of the hottest 15 years on record.<br>
    By 2050, drought and chronic water shortages could impact a billion people, while millions more will be at risk from coastal flooding.<br>
    It can seem overwhelming, but there's reason for hope.<br>
    If we embrace solar and wind power to their full potential, we can cut the world's yearly carbon emissions by a third.<br>
    Already, Germany generates 27% of its electricity from renewables, with a goal of 80% by 2050.<br>
    Denmark has shown it can produce more wind energy than it can use, and England is building the world's biggest offshore wind farm.<br>
    Communities large and small are taking steps.<br>
    A new public building in Mexico City has an exterior that breaks down air pollutants, erasing the effects of 1,000 cars each day.<br>
    Paris installed street tiles that harvest energy from foot traffic.<br>
    Other cities are paving streets with smog-eating concrete, and sidewalks with recycled materials.<br>
    Individuals can make a difference too through the choices we make every day.<br>
    If every American driver drove 10 miles less each week, it could eliminate more than a hundred billion pounds of carbon from the air each year.<br>
    New innovations are making important strides possible, and more are on the way.<br>
    But, we can't wait.<br>
    Reimagining our world's energy future will take a shared sense of urgency from countries, companies, cities, and all of us.<br>
    Working together, real change is possible.<br>
